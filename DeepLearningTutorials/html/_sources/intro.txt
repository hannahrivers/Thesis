Deep Learning Tutorials
=======================

Deep Learning is a new area of Machine Learning research, which
has been introduced with the objective of moving Machine Learning
closer to one of its original goals: Artificial Intelligence.
See these course notes for a `brief introduction to Machine Learning for AI <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6266/H10/notes/mlintro.html>`_
and an `introduction to Deep Learning algorithms <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6266/H10/notes/deepintro.html>`_.

Deep Learning is about learning multiple levels of representation
and abstraction that help to
make sense of data such as images, sound, and text. 
For more about deep learning algorithms, see for example:

 - The monograph or review paper `Learning Deep Architectures for AI <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/239>`_ (Foundations & Trends in Machine Learning, 2009).
 - The ICML 2009 Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies `webpage <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/deeplearning/index.html>`_ has a `list of references <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/deeplearning/references.html>`_.
 - The LISA `public wiki <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/WebHome>`_ has a `reading list <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/ReadingOnDeepNetworks>`_ and a `bibliography <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Public/DeepNetworksBibliography>`_.
 - Geoff Hinton has `readings <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/deeprefs.html>`_ from last year's `NIPS tutorial <http://videolectures.net/jul09_hinton_deeplearn/>`_.

The tutorials presented here will introduce you to some of the most important deep learning
algorithms and will also show you how to run them using Theano_. Theano is a python library that makes writing deep learning models easy, and gives the option of
training them on a GPU.

The algorithm tutorials have some prerequisites.  You should know some python,
and be familiar with numpy. Since this tutorial is about using Theano, you
should read over the `Theano basic tutorial`_ first.  Once you've done that,
read through our :ref:`gettingstarted` chapter -- it introduces the notation, and [downloadable] datasets used in the algorithm tutorials, and the way we do optimization by stochastic gradient descent.  

The purely supervised learning algorithms are meant to be read in order:

  #. :ref:`Logistic Regression <logreg>` - using Theano for something simple
  #. :ref:`Multilayer perceptron <mlp>` - introduction to layers
  #. :ref:`Deep Convolutional Network <lenet>` - a simplified version of LeNet5

The unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms are here (the auto-encoders can be read independently of the RBM/DBN thread):

  * :ref:`Auto Encoders, Denoising Autoencoders <daa>` - description of autoencoders
  * :ref:`Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders <SdA>` - easy steps into unsupervised pre-training for deep nets
  * :ref:`Restricted Boltzmann Machines <rbm>` - single layer generative RBM model
  * :ref:`Deep Belief Networks <DBN>` - unsupervised generative pre-training of stacked RBMs followed by supervised fine-tuning
