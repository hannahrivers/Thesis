download the datasets mentioned in this chapter in order to run the example code of
the up-coming tutorials.

MNIST Dataset
+++++++++++++

(`mnist.pkl.gz <http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz>`_)

 The `MNIST <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist>`_ dataset consists of handwritten 
 digit images and it is divided in 60,000 examples for the training set and 
 10,000 examples for testing. In many papers as well as in this tutorial, the
 official training set of 60,000 is divided into an actual training set of 50,000
 examples and 10,000 validation examples (for selecting hyper-parameters like
 learning rate and size of the model). All digit images have been size-normalized and 
 centered in a fixed size image of 28 x 28 pixels. In the original dataset 
 each pixel of the image is represented by a value between 0 and 255, where 
 0 is black, 255 is  white and anything in between is a different shade of grey. 


 Here are some examples of MNIST digits: 

    |0| |1| |2| |3| |4| |5|

 .. |0| image:: images/mnist_0.png
 .. |1| image:: images/mnist_1.png
 .. |2| image:: images/mnist_2.png
 .. |3| image:: images/mnist_3.png
 .. |4| image:: images/mnist_4.png
 .. |5| image:: images/mnist_5.png
 
 For convenience we pickled the dataset to make it easier to use in python.
 It is available for download `here <http://deeplearning.net/data/mnist/mnist.pkl.gz>`_.
 The pickled file represents a tuple of 3 lists : the training set, the 
 validation set and the testing set. Each of the three lists is a pair
 formed from a list of images and a list of class labels for each of the
 images. An image is represented as numpy 1-dimensional array of 784 (28
 x 28) float values between 0 and 1 (0 stands for black, 1 for white).
 The labels are numbers between 0 and 9 indicating which digit the image
 represents. The code block below shows how to load the dataset. 
 

 .. code-block:: python

    import cPickle, gzip, numpy
 
    # Load the dataset 
    f = gzip.open('mnist.pkl.gz','rb')
    train_set, valid_set, test_set = cPickle.load(f)
    f.close()


 When using the dataset, we usually divide it in minibatches (see
 :ref:`opt_SGD`). We encourage you to store the dataset into shared 
 variables and access it based on the minibatch index, given a fixed 
 and known batch size. The reason behind shared variables is
 related to using the GPU. There is a large overhead when copying data
 into the GPU memory. If you would copy data on request ( each minibatch 
 individually when needed) as the code will do if you do not use shared 
 variables, due to this overhead, the GPU code will not be much faster
 then the CPU code (maybe even slower). If you have your data in 
 Theano shared variables though, you give Theano the possibility to copy 
 the entire data on the GPU in a single call when the shared variables are constructed.
 Afterwards the GPU can access any minibatch by taking a slice from this 
 shared variables, without needing to copy any information from the CPU 
 memory and therefore bypassing the overhead. 
 Because the datapoints and their labels are usually of different nature
 (labels are usually integers while datapoints are real numbers) we
 suggest to use different variables for labes and data. Also we recomand 
 using different variables for the training set, validation set and
 testing set to make the code more readable (resulting in 6 different
 shared variables). 
 
 Since now the data is in one variable, and a minibatch is defined as a
 slice of that variable, it comes more natural to define a minibatch by
 indicating its index and its size. In our setup the batch size stays constant
 through out the execution of the code, therefore a function will actually
 require only the index to identify on which datapoints to work.
 The code below shows how to store your data and how to 
 access a minibatch:

 
 .. code-block:: python

    def shared_dataset(data_xy):
        """ Function that loads the dataset into shared variables
        
        The reason we store our dataset in shared variables is to allow 
        Theano to copy it into the GPU memory (when code is run on GPU). 
        Since copying data into the GPU is slow, copying a minibatch everytime
        is needed (the default behaviour if the data is not in a shared 
        variable) would lead to a large decrease in performance.
        """
        data_x, data_y = data_xy
        shared_x = theano.shared(numpy.asarray(data_x, dtype=theano.config.floatX))
        shared_y = theano.shared(numpy.asarray(data_y, dtype=theano.config.floatX))
        # When storing data on the GPU it has to be stored as floats
        # therefore we will store the labels as ``floatX`` as well
        # (``shared_y`` does exactly that). But during our computations
        # we need them as ints (we use labels as index, and if they are 
        # floats it doesn't make sense) therefore instead of returning 
        # ``shared_y`` we will have to cast it to int. This little hack
        # lets us get around this issue
        return shared_x, T.cast(shared_y, 'int32')

    test_set_x, test_set_y = shared_dataset(test_set)
    valid_set_x, valid_set_y = shared_dataset(valid_set)
    train_set_x, train_set_y = shared_dataset(train_set)

    batch_size = 500    # size of the minibatch

    # accessing the third minibatch of the training set 

    data  = train_set_x[2*500:3*500]
    label = train_set_y[2*500:3*500]


The data has to be stored as floats on the GPU ( the right
``dtype`` for storing on the GPU is given by ``theano.config.floatX``).
To get around this shortcomming for the labels, we store them as float,
and then cast it to int. 

.. note::

    If you are running your code on the GPU and the dataset you are using 
    is too large to fit in memory the code will crash. In such a case you
    should store the data in a shared variable. You can however store a 
    sufficiently small chunk of your data (several minibatches) in a shared
    variable and use that during training. Once you got through the chunk,
    update the values it stores. This way you minimize the number of data 
    transfers between CPU memory and GPU memory.

Notation

.. index:: Dataset notation

Dataset notation
++++++++++++++++

We label data sets as :math:`\mathcal{D}`. When the distinction is important, we
indicate train, validation, and test sets as: :math:`\mathcal{D}_{train}`,
:math:`\mathcal{D}_{valid}` and :math:`\mathcal{D}_{test}`. The validation set
is used to perform model selection and hyper-parameter selection, whereas
the test set is used to evaluate the final generalization error and
compare different algorithms in an unbiased way.

The tutorials mostly deal with classification problems, where each data set
:math:`\mathcal{D}` is an indexed set of pairs :math:`(x^{(i)},y^{(i)})`. We
use superscripts to distinguish training set examples: :math:`x^{(i)} \in
\mathcal{R}^D` is thus the i-th training example of dimensionality :math:`D`. Similarly,
:math:`y^{(i)} \in \{0, ..., L\}` is the i-th label assigned to input
:math:`x^{(i)}`. It is straightforward to extend these examples to
ones where :math:`y^{(i)}` has other types (e.g. Gaussian for regression,
or groups of multinomials for predicting multiple symbols).

A Primer on Supervised Optimization for Deep Learning
=====================================================

.. _stoch-grad-label:

What's exciting about Deep Learning is largely the use of unsupervised learning
of deep networks.  But supervised learning also plays an important role.  The
utility of unsupervised *pre-training* is often evaluated on the basis of what
performance can be achieved after supervised *fine-tuning*.  This chapter
reviews the basics of supervised learning for classification models, and covers
the minibatch stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is used to fine-tune
many of the models in the Deep Learning Tutorials. Have a look at these
`introductory course notes on gradient-based learning <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~pift6266/H10/notes/gradient.html>`_
for more basics on the notion of optimizing a training criterion using the gradient.


.. _opt_learn_classifier:


Learning a Classifier
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. index:: Zero-One Loss

Zero-One Loss
-------------

The models presented in these deep learning tutorials are mostly used
for classification. The objective in training a classifier is to minimize the number
of errors (zero-one loss) on unseen examples. If :math:`f: R^D \rightarrow
\{0,...,L\}` is the prediction function, then this loss can be written as:

.. math::
    
    \ell_{0,1} = \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathcal{D}|} I_{f(x^{(i)}) \neq y^{(i)}}
    
where either :math:`\mathcal{D}` is the training
set (during training)
or :math:`\mathcal{D} \cap \mathcal{D}_{train} = \emptyset` 
(to avoid biasing the evaluation of validation or test error). :math:`I` is the
indicator function defined as:

.. math::

    I_x = \left\{\begin{array}{ccc} 
          1&\mbox{ if $x$ is True} \\
          0&\mbox{ otherwise}\end{array}\right.

In this tutorial, :math:`f` is defined as:

.. math::
    
    f(x) = {\rm argmax}_k P(Y=k | x, \theta)

In python, using Theano this can be written as :

.. code-block:: python

  # zero_one_loss is a Theano variable representing a symbolic
  # expression of the zero one loss ; to get the actual value this
  # symbolic expression has to be compiled into a Theano function (see
  # the Theano tutorial for more details)
  zero_one_loss = T.sum(T.neq(T.argmax(p_y_given_x),y))


.. index:: Negative Log--Likelihood Loss

Negative Log-Likelihood Loss
----------------------------

Since the zero-one loss is not differentiable, optimizing it for large models
(thousands or millions of parameters) is prohibitively expensive
(computationally). We thus maximize the log-likelihood of our classifier given
all the labels in a training set.

.. math::

    \mathcal{L}(\theta, \mathcal{D}) = 
        \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathcal{D}|} \log P(Y=y^{(i)} | x^{(i)}, \theta)

The likelihood of the correct class is not the same as the
number of right predictions, but from the point of view of a randomly
initialized classifier they are pretty similar. 
Remember that likelihood and zero-one loss are different objectives;
you should see that they are corralated on the validation set but
sometimes one will rise while the other falls, or vice-versa.

Since we usually speak in terms of minimizing a loss function, learning will
thus attempt to **minimize** the **negative** log-likelihood (NLL), defined
as:

.. math::

    NLL(\theta, \mathcal{D}) = - \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathcal{D}|} \log P(Y=y^{(i)} | x^{(i)}, \theta)

The NLL of our classifier is a differentiable surrogate for the zero-one loss,
and we use the gradient of this function over our training data as a
supervised learning signal for deep learning of a classifier.

This can be computed using the following line of code : 

.. code-block:: python

  # NLL is a symbolic variable ; to get the actual value of NLL, this symbolic
  # expression has to be compiled into a Theano function (see the Theano
  # tutorial for more details)
  NLL = -T.sum(T.log(p_y_given_x)[T.arange(y.shape[0]),y])
  # note on syntax: T.arange(y.shape[0]) is a vector of integers [0,1,2,...,len(y)].
  # Indexing a matrix M by the two vectors [0,1,...,K], [a,b,...,k] returns the
  # elements M[0,a], M[1,b], ..., M[K,k] as a vector.  Here, we use this
  # syntax to retrieve the log-probability of the correct labels, y.


.. index:: Stochastic Gradient Descent

.. _opt_SGD:

Stochastic Gradient Descent
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

What is ordinary gradient descent?  it is a simple
algorithm in which we repeatedly make small steps downward on an error 
surface defined by a loss function of some parameters.  
For the purpose of ordinary gradient descent we consider that the training 
data is rolled into the loss function. Then the pseudocode of this
algorithm can be described as :

.. code-block:: python

    # GRADIENT DESCENT

    while True:
        loss = f(params)
        d_loss_wrt_params = ... # compute gradient
        params -= learning_rate * d_loss_wrt_params
        if <stopping condition is met>:
            return params

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) works according to the same principles as
ordinary gradient descent, but proceeds more quickly by estimating the gradient from just
a few examples at a time instead of the entire training set.  In its purest
form, we estimate the gradient from just a single example at a time.

.. code-block:: python

    # STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT
    for (x_i,y_i) in training_set:  
                                # imagine an infinite generator 
                                # that may repeat examples (if there is only a finite training set)
        loss = f(params, x_i, y_i)
        d_loss_wrt_params = ... # compute gradient
        params -= learning_rate * d_loss_wrt_params
        if <stopping condition is met>:
            return params

The variant that we recommend for deep learning is a further twist on
stochastic gradient descent using so-called "minibatches".  
Minibatch SGD works identically to SGD, except that we use more than
one training example to make each estimate of the gradient.  This technique reduces
variance in the estimate of the gradient, and often makes better use of the
hierarchical memory organization in modern computers. 

.. code-block:: python

    for (x_batch,y_batch) in train_batches:  
                                # imagine an infinite generator 
                                # that may repeat examples
        loss = f(params, x_batch, y_batch)
        d_loss_wrt_params = ... # compute gradient using theano
        params -= learning_rate * d_loss_wrt_params
        if <stopping condition is met>:
            return params


There is a tradeoff in the choice of the minibatch size :math:`B`.  The
reduction of variance and use of SIMD instructions helps most when increasing
:math:`B` from 1 to 2, but the marginal improvement fades rapidly to nothing.
With large :math:`B`, time is wasted in reducing the variance of the gradient
estimator, that time would be better spent on additional gradient steps.
An optimal :math:`B` is model-, dataset-, and hardware-dependent, and can be
anywhere from 1 to maybe several hundreds.  In the tutorial we set it to 20, 
but this choice is almost arbitrary (though harmless). 

.. note::

    If you are training for a fixed number of epochs, the minibatch size becomes important 
    because it controls the number of updates done to your parameters. Training the same model
    for 10 epochs using a batch size of 1 yields completely different results compared
    to training for the same 10 epochs but with a batchsize of 20. Keep this in mind when
    switching between batch sizes and be prepared to tweak all the other parameters acording 
    to the batch size used.
    
All code-blocks above show pseudocode of how the algorithm looks like. Implementing such 
algorithm in Theano can be done as follows : 

.. code-block:: python

    # Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent
    
    # assume loss is a symbolic description of the loss function given
    # the symbolic variables params (shared variable), x_batch, y_batch; 

    # compute gradient of loss with respect to params
    d_loss_wrt_params = T.grad(loss, params)
  
    # compile the MSGD step into a theano function
    updates = { params: params - learning_rate * d_loss_wrt_params}
    MSGD = theano.function([x_batch,y_batch], loss, updates = updates)

    for (x_batch, y_batch) in train_batches:
        # here x_batch and y_batch are elements of train_batches and
        # therefore numpy arrays; function MSGD also updates the params
        print('Current loss is ', MSGD(x_batch, y_batch))
        if stopping_condition_is_met:
            return params


.. index:: Regularization

Regularization
++++++++++++++

There is more to machine learning than optimization.  When we
train our model from data we are trying to prepare it to do well on *new*
examples, not the ones it has already seen.  The training loop above for MSGD
does not take this into account, and may overfit the training examples.
A way to combat overfitting is through regularization.
There are several techniques for regularization; the ones we will explain 
here are L1/L2 regularization and early-stopping.

.. index:: L1 and L2 regularization

.. _L1_L2_regularization :

L1 and L2 regularization
------------------------

L1 and L2 regularization involve adding an extra term to the loss function,
which penalizes certain parameter configurations. Formally, if our loss function is:

.. math::

    NLL(\theta, \mathcal{D}) = - \sum_{i=0}^{|\mathcal{D}|} \log P(Y=y^{(i)} | x^{(i)}, \theta) 

then the regularized loss will be:

.. math::

	E(\theta, \mathcal{D}) =  NLL(\theta, \mathcal{D}) + \lambda R(\theta)\\

or, in our case

.. math::

	E(\theta, \mathcal{D}) =  NLL(\theta, \mathcal{D}) + \lambda||\theta||_p^p

where

.. math::
	
	||\theta||_p = \left(\sum_{j=0}^{|\theta|}{|\theta_j|^p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}

which is the :math:`L_p` norm of :math:`\theta`. :math:`\lambda` is a hyper-parameter which
controls the relative importance of the regularization parameter. Commonly used values for p
are 1 and 2, hence the L1/L2 nomenclature. If p=2, then the regularizer is
also called "weight decay".

In principle, adding a regularization term to the loss will encourage smooth
network mappings in a neural network (by penalizing large values of the
parameters, which decreases the amount of nonlinearity that the
network models). More intuitively, the two terms (NLL and :math:`R(\theta)`)
correspond to modelling the data well (NLL) and having "simple" or "smooth"
solutions (:math:`R(\theta)`). Thus, minimizing the sum of both will, in
theory, correspond to finding the right trade-off between the fit to the
training data and the "generality" of the solution that is found. To follow
Occam's razor principle, this minimization should find us the simplest
solution (as measured by our simplicity criterion) that fits the training
data. 

Note that the fact that a solution is "simple" does not mean that it will
generalize well. Empirically, it was found that performing such regularization
in the context of neural networks helps with generalization, especially
on small datasets.
The code block below shows how to compute the loss in python when it
contains both a L1 regularization term weighted by :math:`\lambda_1` and
L2 regularization term weighted by :math:`\lambda_2`

.. code-block:: python
 
  # symbolic Theano variable that represents the L1 regularization term
  L1  = T.sum(abs(param))

  # symbolic Theano variable that represents the squared L2 term 
  L2_sqr = T.sum(param**2)

  # the loss 
  loss = NLL + lambda_1 * L1 + lambda_2 * L2



.. index:: Early-Stopping

.. _opt_early_stopping:


Early-Stopping
--------------

Early-stopping combats overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on a
*validation set*.  A validation set is a set of examples that we never use for
gradient descent, but which is also not a part of the *test set*.  The
validation examples are considered to be representative of future test examples.
We can use them during training because they are not part of the test set.
If the model's performance ceases to improve sufficiently on the
validation set, or even degrades with further optimization, then the
heuristic implemented here gives up on much further optimization.  


The choice of when to stop is a
judgement call and a few heuristics exist, but these tutorials will make use
of a strategy based on a geometrically increasing amount of patience.

.. code-block:: python

    # early-stopping parameters
    patience              = 5000  # look as this many examples regardless
    patience_increase     = 2     # wait this much longer when a new best is 
                                  # found
    improvement_threshold = 0.995 # a relative improvement of this much is 
                                  # considered significant
    validation_frequency  = min(n_train_batches, patience/2)  
                                  # go through this many 
                                  # minibatches before checking the network 
                                  # on the validation set; in this case we 
                                  # check every epoch 

    best_params          = None
    best_validation_loss = numpy.inf
    test_score           = 0.
    start_time = time.clock()

    done_looping = False 
    epoch = 0  
    while (epoch < n_epochs) and (not done_looping):
        epoch = epoch + 1
        for minibatch_index in xrange(n_train_batches):

            d_loss_wrt_params = ... # compute gradient
            params -= learning_rate * d_loss_wrt_params # gradient descent

            # iteration number
            iter = epoch * n_train_batches + minibatch_index
            # note that if we do `iter % validation_frequency` it will be
            # true for iter = 0 which we do not want
            if iter and iter % validation_frequency == 0: 

                this_validation_loss = ... # compute zero-one loss on validation set

                if this_validation_loss < best_validation_loss:

                    # improve patience if loss improvement is good enough
                    if this_validation_loss < best_validation_loss*improvement_threshold:

                        patience = max(patience, iter * patience_increase)
                    best_params = copy.deepcopy(params)
                    best_validation_loss = this_validation_loss

            if patience <= iter:
                done_looping = True
                break

    # POSTCONDITION:
    # best_params refers to the best out-of-sample parameters observed during the optimization

If we run out of batches of training data before running out of patience, then
we just go back to the beginning of the training set and repeat.  


.. note::
    
    The ``validation_frequency`` should always be smaller than the
    ``patience``. The code should check at least two times how it
    performs before running out of patience. This is the reason we used
    the formulation ``validation_frequency = min( value, patience/2.)``

.. note::

    This algorithm could possibly be improved by using a test of statistical significance
    rather than the simple comparison, when deciding whether to increase the
    patience.



.. index:: Testing

Testing
+++++++

After the loop exits, the best_params variable refers to the best-performing
model on the validation set.  If we repeat this procedure for another model
class, or even another random initialization, we should use the same
train/valid/test split of the data, and get other best-performing
models.  If we have to choose what the best model class or the best
initialization was, we compare the best_validation_loss for each model.  When
we have finally chosen the model we think is the best (on validation data), we
report that model's test set performance.  That is the performance we expect on
unseen examples.

Recap
+++++

That's it for the optimization section.
The technique of early-stopping requires us to partition the set of examples into three sets 
(training :math:`\mathcal{D}_{train}`,
validation :math:`\mathcal{D}_{valid}`,
test :math:`\mathcal{D}_{test}`). 
The training set is used for minibatch stochastic gradient descent on the
differentiable approximation of the objective function.
As we perform this gradient descent, we periodically consult the validation set
to see how our model is doing on the real objective function (or at least our
empirical estimate of it).
When we see a good model on the validation set, we save it.
When it has been a long time since seeing a good model, we abandon our search
and return the best parameters found, for evaluation on the test set.




Theano/Python Tips
===================

Loading and Saving Models
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you're doing experiments, it can take hours (sometimes days!) for
gradient-descent to find the best parameters.  You will want to save those
weights once you find them.  You may also want to save your current-best
estimates as the search progresses.

**Pickle the numpy ndarrays from your shared variables**

The best way to save/archive your model's parameters is to use pickle or
deepcopy the ndarray objects.  So for example, if your parameters are in
shared variables ``w, v, u``, then your save command should look something
like:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import cPickle
    >>> save_file = open('path', 'wb')  # this will overwrite current contents
    >>> cPickle.dump(w.get_value(borrow=True), save_file, -1) # the -1 is for HIGHEST_PROTOCOL
    >>> cPickle.dump(v.get_value(borrow=True), save_file, -1) # .. and it triggers much more efficient
    >>> cPickle.dump(u.get_value(borrow=True), save_file, -1) # .. storage than numpy's default
    >>> save_file.close()

Then later, you can load your data back like this:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> save_file = open('path')
    >>> w.set_value(cPickle.load(save_file), borrow=True)
    >>> v.set_value(cPickle.load(save_file), borrow=True)
    >>> u.set_value(cPickle.load(save_file), borrow=True)

This technique is a bit verbose, but it is tried and true.  You will be able
to load your data and render it in matplotlib without trouble, years after
saving it.

**Do not pickle your training or test functions for long-term storage**

Theano functions are compatible with Python's deepcopy and pickle mechanisms,
but you should not necessarily pickle a Theano function.  If you update your
Theano folder and one of the internal changes, then you may not be able to
un-pickle your model.  Theano is still in active development, and the internal
APIs are subject to change.  So to be on the safe side -- do not pickle your
entire training or testing functions for long-term storage.  The pickle
mechanism is aimed at for short-term storage, such as a temp file, or a copy to
another machine in a distributed job.

Plotting Intermediate Results
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Visualizations can be very powerful tools for understanding what your model or
training algorithm is doing.  You might be tempted to insert ``matplotlib``
plotting commands, or ``PIL`` image-rendering commands into your model-training
script.  However, later you will observe something interesting in one of those
pre-rendered images and want to investigate something that isn't clear from
the pictures.  You'll wished you had saved the original model.

**If you have enough disk space, your training script should save intermediate models and  a visualization
script should process those saved models.**

You already have a model-saving function right?  Just use it again to save
these intermediate models.

Libraries you'll want to know about: Python Image Library (`PIL`_), `matplotlib`_.
