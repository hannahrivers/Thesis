Plotting Samples and Filters

To plot a sample, what we need to do is to take the visible units, which 
are a flattened image (there is no 2D structure to the visible units,
just a 1D string of unit activations) and reshape it into a 2D image. The order in
which the points from the 1D array go into the 2D image is given by the 
order in which the inital MNIST images where converted into a 1D array.
Lucky for us this is just a call of the ``numpy.reshape`` function.

Plotting the weights is a bit more tricky. We have ``n_hidden`` hidden
units, each of them corresponding to a column of the weight matrix. A 
column has the same shape as the visible, where the weight corresponding 
to the connection with visible unit `j` is at position `j`. Therefore,
if we reshape every such column, using ``numpy.reshape``, we get a
filter image that tells us how this hidden unit is influenced by 
the input image.

We need a utility function that takes a minibatch, or the weight matrix, 
and converts each row ( for the weight matrix we do a transpose ) into a 
2D image and then tile these images together.  Once we converted the
minibatch or the weights in this image of tiles, we can use PIL to plot 
and save. `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_ is a standard 
python libarary to deal with images.

Tiling minibatches together is done for us by the 
``tile_raster_image`` function which we provide here.

    and also columns of matrices for transforming those rows 
    (such as the first layer of a neural net).
